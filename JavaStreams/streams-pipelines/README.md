#### Printable String spec
A multiline String containing a formatted table of all results and total values and marks.\
Headers are required.\
Column width depends on values lenghts.\
Sort rows by students last names.\
Sort columns by task name.\
Double values formatted to 2 digits after the point.\
Average mark is simple a mark of average total score.\
Pay attention to alignment of different columns.
 
 
Example:
